# David Dedić
I enjoy lower-level programming, ranging from AVR assembly to CUDA

The languages I would say I am proficient in: C, CUDA, ARM Asm, AVR Asm

I have a working proficiency in C++, but am by no means good at it

## Projects worth mentioning
- All of my pinned projects!
- My small STM32 microkernel

    Finished a round robin co-op scheduler with timeouts, ipc(via mailbox system), and a simple memory allocator

- My almost finished compiler (small_avr_compiler)
  
    Finished the tokenizer, parser to generate AST, small arduino emulator, and started the actual assembly generator
- Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics
  
    Got around to implementing a fast particle rendering and storing system with bounding boxes, and made an effecient parallelized lookup system, but never finished actual fluid dynamics

## Interesting stuff outside of Git
- I spent a few months of my life designing parts of a simple computer in a logic gate simulator.

    I only got around to making a simple ALU and registers, but it was definitely fun to do. I would recommend at least trying this once.

**Fun Note:** I am very proud of my profile picture :)
